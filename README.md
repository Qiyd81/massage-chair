# Massage chair, 2014
In this project the teacher required us to create a chair using PVC tubes, the project had to be creative and well documented.
As I knew how to use an Arduino, our group decided to implement a massage box in the backrest of the chair,
using motors and adding unbalanced weight to the axis so it would vibrate.


## Budjet & Design
### First I designed and set the measurements of the pvc tubes so we knew how many meters we needed:

### From the projections, we kept documenting every expense as part of the project deliverables:
