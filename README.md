# Massage chair, 2014
In this project the teacher required us to create a chair using PVC tubes, the project had to be creative and well documented.
As I knew how to use an Arduino, our group decided to implement a massage box in the backrest of the chair,
using motors and adding unbalanced weight to the axis so it would vibrate.
